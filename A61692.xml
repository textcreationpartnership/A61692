            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> A <hi>Pamphlet, or little book being come to my hands, intituled,</hi> Chriſtian Queries to Quaking Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c. By one who ſubſcribes himſelf</hi> I. B. <hi>with an Epistle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from one who ſubſcribes himſelf</hi> I. A. <hi>And I having duly weighed, and ſeriouſly conſidered both the Epiſtle, and the Queries, I return this following Reply againſt two things in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, with an Anſwer to the Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, to the Epiſtle, in the Frontiſpiece of which <hi>I. A.</hi> ſaith,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Go little book, improve thy Scripture skill,</l>
               <l>Advance the truth, and throw down all ſelf-will.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> IT is not in the power of that little book, or any other writing, how holy, or good ſoever they may be in themſelves, either to advance the truth, or beat down the ſelf-will, &amp; haughty pride of man; farther then they are accompanied with the living word, Spirit, and power of the Lord God: therefore may I ſay, much more it is not in the power of that little Book, either to throw down ſelf-will in any, in whom it is not yet ſubdued, or to exalt the truth in general; becauſe its only queries, gathered by the Authour from the Letter of the Scriptures without, and no meſſage of heavenly propheſy, doctrine, or exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, received by the Authour from the Lord, through the divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his light, and Spirit within, whoſe light, Spirit, and power operating in the hearts of men, is that only means, which becomes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to accompliſh the things before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the laying low the pride of all fleſh, and the exaltation of the name, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uth of God, in the world. Therefore may I ſay, it's a very vain, and idolatrous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which <hi>I. A.</hi> hath given to <hi>I. B.</hi> his little book.</p>
            <p>And <hi>I. A.</hi> further ſaith, <hi>Let light without be guide to light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If by this exhortation <hi>I. A.</hi> means, that light without ſhould guide the true light, which ſhines in the hearts of Saints, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but gather from the forementioned words: then, I muſt needs ſay, 'tis a very abſurd, and fooliſh exhortation, and being ſpoken upon a divine account; it is very full of idolatry, and evil, and greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel, and exhortation of Gods Embaſſadours to the Saints upon earth; which was, that they ſhould abide in the light, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95207:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> anointing that was in them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. And the Apoſtle preferreth the light, that God hath cauſed to ſhine into their hearts, ſo far beyond any periſhing thing, or light without, that he exalts it, as that excellent means, by which he, &amp; the Saints received the knowledge unto everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Where he ſaith, <hi>God, who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Many more teſtimonies proving the ſame truth, might be inſtanced. And though the holy Scriptures without, and the Saints practiſes are as lights in the world: yet far be it from all true Chriſtian men, ſo to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize them; as to ſet them in eſteem above the light, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to guide, or to eſteem them equal with the light, and Spirit of Chriſt within, from which the Scriptures were given forth, which are but branches of that holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oot, and as it were fruits of that heavenly tree, <hi>viz.</hi> the appearance of God in the hearts of his people. If <hi>I. A.</hi> had bid people mind the doctrines, and exhortations of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which teſtifies of, and exhorts to Chriſt, the true, and never er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring light, in the hearts of his followers, he had done better. But what I have already in love ſaid, I ſhall leave to his more ſerious, and better conſideration.</p>
            <p>1. Query. <hi>How, and by what means may ſalvation be attained, whether by adhering to light within us, or by faith in Christ without us?</hi> (1) <hi>if the later be not the beſt way, why is it, that the Scriptures do ſo often bid us to believe in Jeſus Christ, and that by ſo doing, we may be ſaved,</hi> 3 Joh. 15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31. (2) <hi>or if the former be the better way? if ſo I would then ask farther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Salvation is to be obtained through believing, and walking in the obedience unto Chriſt Jeſus, who is that only true and ſaving light, which lighteth every man that comes into the world, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. 9. And all mankind, who cometh out of that night of darkneſſe, which hath overſhadowed the whole world, and from under the cloud of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that hath covered all the inhabitants of the earth, muſt both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, receive, and walk in the light of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24. which is the beſt and moſt excellent way: though we muſt confeſſe, as Jeſus, the true light of the world, is God bleſſed forever; our veſſels are not able to contain him, becauſe his preſence is infinite, and fills heaven and earth; and as he is thus infinite in himſelf, we muſt confeſſe, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95207:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> he is as real without us as within us: yet the true knowledge and faith, which we with all the Saints have in Chriſt unto our ſalvation, is not of him at a diſtance without us, but even in him, as he is near at hand, by his light, and ſpirit revealed within us; according to what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>That, which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>To whom God would make known, what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongſt the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi> Therefore I ſay, the hope, which we with all true Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans have, whereby we may attain heaven, where all felicity and happineſſe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for ever, is not by any knowledge of Chriſt at a diſtance without us, but as he is inwardly revealed, by his light and Spirit in our hearts; and they who thus know him, have and do experience the virtue of his precious bloud, which was ſhed for many, to waſh away their ſin, and to purge them from all their tranſgreſſions. And this is that knowledge, which a man may have, and not dye, for the ſoul that hath it lives to God in this world, and ſhall reign with Chriſt to all eternity, in the world to come. And becauſe this is the beſt and moſt excellent way for Chriſtians both to believe in, and receive Chriſt unto their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation; therefore it is, that the holy Scriptures teſtifie of Chriſt being revealed unto the Saints, in this way: but neither the Scriptures which thou haſt inſtanced, nor any other exhorts Chriſtians to believe in Chriſt, as he is at a diſtance without them; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>2. Query. <hi>Whether the light within us be a ſufficient guide to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us unto true happineſſe? and what this light is? whether in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man? or how to be attained?</hi> (1.) <hi>if this light be ſufficient to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, of what uſe are the Scriptures? And why are we at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted unto faith, which implyeth ſomething at a diſtance, and not yet enioyed?</hi> Heb. 11. 1. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The light of Jeſus within us is a ſufficient guide to direct and lead us, which all them that walk in it, out of darkneſſe and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the inheritance of glory, and joy with the ſanctified in Chriſts ſpiritual K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngdome, according as our Saviour, who is this light, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 8. 12. where he ſaith, <hi>I am the light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but have the light of life;</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> propheſying of him, whoſe light is ſufficient to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95207:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> guide men out of errour and darkneſſe, ſaith <hi>Luke,</hi> 1. 78, 79. through the tender mercy of our God, the day ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. By theſe two teſtimonies may this truth be confirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the light of Jeſus, which ſhines within us, is ſufficient both to direct and lead us to true happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this true light, (in which we walk, &amp; give teſtimony to the world, and ſay, it is that unto which all mankind muſt be turned, that come to receive remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18.) is no other, but even Jeſus the everlaſting ſon of God, as the Scriptures teſtifieth, <hi>John.</hi> 1. 9. and <hi>John</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21, 24.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This true light lighteth every man, as it is before already proved, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. And he that deſires to attain the knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the true light, let him not ſay in his heart, who ſhall aſcend, or deſcend, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and 6. 7. for Chriſt the light is near, whoſe beams, in a ſmall meaſure, ſhines in the darkneſſe of his heart, according to <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. 5. and may be known by its operation of manifeſting the ſecret evils there, which are reproved, and through it, he comes to have a deſcerning between the inward thoughts, and deſires, which would incline his heart towards God; and thoſe which would, or doth cauſe his heart to decline from God: therefore he that would attain to the knowledge of Chriſt, (whoſe light gives him in ſome meaſure the knowledge of himſelf, as is before ſaid) muſt in love and obedience to Chriſt (whoſe light convinceth him of ſin) confeſſe and forſake his ſin, in which obedience man comes to receive that heavenly power of God, which begets him again out of ſin and death, and makes him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the divine nature, and life of Chriſt, the light, in which he comes to ſee light, &amp; to have the excellent knowledge of that everlaſting ſon, through which, in ſome meaſure, he ſaw the filthineſſe of ſin, and the motions of it in his heart; while as yet he had not the knowledge of the light, neither could it comprehend.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe this light is ſufficient, of great uſe are the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which teſtifieth of, and directeth to this light, and exhorteth, Chriſtians to the growing in faith, and belief in Jeſus, who is the true light, and Saviour of the world, and able to ſave to the utmoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.</p>

            <p>3. Query. <hi>Whether is this light the conſcience of every man? or</hi> (3.) <hi>is it Christ in every man? if ſo, why then are not all men ſaved? for if he that hath not this light be out of Chriſt (as you ſay) then all, that have this light, muſt of neceſſity be in Chriſt, and conſequently ſaved,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This light is not the conſcience of every man, neither is it the conſcience of any man, but is that heavenly light, by which God lightens the conſciences of the ſons of men, to diſtinguiſh between good and evil, as I have already ſaid. And all they that believe in, and obey the motions of Gods Spirit, by the light of his Son, he will lead them out of all darkneſſe, and errour, and guide them in the way everlaſting, and he will give them richly to poſſeſſe, the evidence of his light and Spirit upon their conſciences, that they are his children. Herein they come to partake of that peace which never ſhall have an end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though we do not ſay, that every man knows, or hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt within; yet we ſay the beams of his light lighteth all men, in which his grace, that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to them, 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. And hereby his good Spirit is tendered to inſtruct them, notwithſtanding they rebell againſt him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 20, 26. And this is the cauſe, that all men are not ſaved, <hi>viz.</hi> their not believing in, but rejecting the light of his ſalvation, and rebelling againſt his Spirit, which ſhould inſtruct them in the way thereof, through which Spirit, all men that continue in ſin ſhall be left without excuſe, whoſe deſtruction is of themſelves.</p>
            <p>4. Query. <hi>Whether that way which you teach, and the doctrines you maintain and propagate, be conſonant to, and may be defended by the word of God, contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be not neceſſary to haue ſome rule of trial, by which we may try the ſpirits, whether they be of God, or no?</hi> 1 John 4. 1, 2, 3. <hi>And</hi> (2.) <hi>whether the Scriptures be not ſufficient thereunto, or is there any better way to be propounded for ſuch a tryal? and</hi> (3.) <hi>if there be any better way, why are we directed by the Prophet</hi> Eſaiah <hi>to the Law, and to the teſtimony, and if any man ſpeak otherwiſe, it is becauſe there is no light in him? as</hi> Eſai. 8. 20. <hi>and</hi> (4.) <hi>why were the</hi> Bereans <hi>commended for ſearching the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo?</hi> Act. 17. 11. <hi>Laſtly, if the Scriptures are not to be the rule for all Doctrines, why is it that the Apostle doth ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95207:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>and that over and over again, pronounce a curſe againſt all ſuch as ſhould preach any other Goſpel, then what he had already preached? which is onely to be found in the Scriptures, as</hi> Gal. 1. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The doctrines, which we maintain and propagate, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to, and may be defended by the forceable arguments of truth, and holy records thereof contained in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is neceſſary to have a rule of tryal, to try the ſpirits, whether they be of God, as <hi>I. B.</hi> hath already inſtanced, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. And he, that in ſome meaſure hath it not, is not yet ſettled, or ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Gods foundation; but is unſtable, and may be toſſed to and fro, by every wind of doctrine, ready to be beguiled by every falſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and device of the enemy of the ſoul inwardly, and to be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide with the cunning craftineſſe of evil men outwardly; even like a ſhip without an anchor, left to the mercy of the wind, and the ſeas, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſuffer ſhipwrack every moment, therefore how wholeſome was the counſel of our Saviour to his Diſciples, to have ſalt in themſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 50. and he tells them that they are the ſalt of the earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 15. he that wants this ſalt which ſeaſons, gives to ſavour, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between what is of God, and what is not of God, is, or may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be deceived, or miſled by that ſpirit of errour, through which men becomes veſſels of wrath, fitted for deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Scriptures are not the moſt ſufficient rule of tryal, (not in any diſpraiſe unto them be it ſpoken) becauſe it is poſſible that men, by that Spirit, which is not of God, may not only ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, but uſe the very ſame words, as the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt did, and do unto this day; ſo that (whiles they ſpeak not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary words or doctrines) that Spirit at many times cannot by the rule of Scriptures be detected: though it's true, many Spirits there are, which may be proved not to be of God by the Scriptures, for their ſpeaking and acting contrary thereunto: but the forementioned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (which is Satan transformed into an angel of light, or into a perſon, who hath ſometimes propheſied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> Spirit, from which the Scriptures were given forth, and though many have, and may be zealous for the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; yet thereby they do not diſcern Satan in this deceivable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95207:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> in which he ſteals the words of the true prophets, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of words, and doctrine may ſeem to ſpeak like an angel, or meſſenger of God, even ſpeaking the ſame words with a falſe ſpirit, as hath ſometimes been ſpoken through the ſame perſon by the true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but the inward knowledge of this is a great myſtery, which is hid from all worldly, and ſinfull men: but is opened by the Lord unto that ſpiritual man, which judgeth all things, yea, Angels, who are made able to put a true difference between the angels of God, that in truth ſerve him, and thoſe, who in outward appearance ſeem to be his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and yet ſerve him not: therefore ſpiritual and heavenly men have a more ſure rule to try ſpirits by, then the Scriptures, which is the unction that they have received from the Holy One, (1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20.) that gives them to diſcern of ſpirits, and the matters that belong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that differs in nature and quality. though not in profeſſion, nor outward appearance: and this is that infallible rule of tryal, which may (and not with any derogation from the authority which belongs to the holy Scriptures) truly be ſaid to be better then the Scriptures; inſomuch as it is the ſame life and Spirit of Chriſt, manifeſt in the hearts of Saints, from which the Scriptures were given forth: and therefore muſt in all things have the preheminence. For this holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the hearts of true Chriſtians, is that ſpiritual law in Chriſt Jeſus, through which they have the teſtimony, (as their father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had) of Chriſts glorious day, in the ſight of which their hearts are made exceeding glad; and if any man want light to diſcern and try what ſpirits are of God, and what ſpirits are not of God, let him look into the ſpiritual law of Chriſt, which is a light that ſhines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, through which the heavenly teſtimony is received; as it is written, If any man want light, let him look upon the law, and the teſtimony, and ſee, if they ſpeak not according to this meaning, as the old tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation renders it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though the Scriptures be not the moſt infallible ſure rule to try all doctrines by, (as is before ſhewed) yet I ſay, curſed be that man that preacheth another Goſpel, then that which the Scriptures teſtifies of, which is the power of God unto ſalvation, as it is preached by the ſame divine authority and power, as it was in the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: but that either the power, or all the words of the Goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95207:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Evangeliſt, <hi>John</hi> 31. and the laſt. <hi>There are alſo many other things. which Jeſus did, the which if they ſhould be written every one, I ſuppoſe that even the world it ſelf could not contain the books that ſhould be written, Amen.</hi> And doubtleſſe many heavenly and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving doctrines were preached by the Apoſtles, as they ran to and fro upon earth in that Goſpel-day, (in which knowledge was encreaſed) which we have not extant at this day: therefore all the wholeſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and exhortations that they preached, are not <hi>[only]</hi> to be ſound in the Scriptures,</p>
            <p>4. Query. <hi>Whether all men do or may attain perfection in this life? and whether any that come ſhort of this perfection may be ſaved; or</hi> (1.) <hi>Whether thoſe texts of Scripture that exhorts us to be perfect, may not imply certain degrees of perfection, rather then perfection it ſelf, as to the heighth of it? And</hi> (2.) <hi>whether there be not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſincerity, as well as of degrees? And</hi> (3.) <hi>whether belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may not be perfect by imputation of his righteouſneſs, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſin, yet was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All men do not attain perfection in this life, becauſe many there are that do reject the means ordained by our heavenly Father, through which otherwiſe they might receive freedome from ſin, and obtain perfect dominion over it, to reign in victory with the Lamb for evermore.</p>
            <p>All that die in the faith of Chriſt ſhall be ſaved, though they be even babes in Chriſt, and far ſhort of that attainment in life, wiſedom, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and ſtrength (as to the fulneſſe of it) as it is manifeſt in the perfect man, who is come even to the meaſure of the ſtature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. In whom all rule, and authority, and power contrary to God, is put down, and he crowned with perfect dominion over all his ſpiritual enemies, reigning as a King in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant victory over ſin, death, and the grave, in the image of the heavenly which he bears, in which the perfect life of the new man is known, that walks with God in this world, and that ſhall live and reign with him perpetually in the world to come; for ſpirituall men in this triumphant ſtate, have received the end for which the bleſſed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel was given, which was for the perfecting of the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95207:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> But, as I have already ſaid, the Saints which die in the faith ſhall be ſaved, though they be far ſhort of that excellent ſtate of perfect men in Chriſt, who are witneſſes of his fulneſſe and ſtature. For ſome of Gods people die, or put off this earthly tabernacle ſoon after their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while they are but even young in the faith, and children, even babes in the truth of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; yet through faith they are heirs of the promiſe, and by the birth immortal they have a true title to the Kingdome of God, though ſuch who are weak in the faith may be ſo aſſaulted many times with doubts, falſe fears, and temptations of the evil one, and in their departure even ſo ſtrongly beſet, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man in Chriſt is not, becauſe all his ſpiritual enemies are conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and put in ſubjection: ſo that he is in reſt, being perfectly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the earthly houſe of this tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, he hath a houſe not made with hands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thoſe Scriptures, which exhort to perfection, doubtleſſe intends perfection it ſelf in the heighth of it, as well as in the degrees; though the Saints (which attains it) attain it by degrees, as by growing from one degree of grace and ſtrength in Chriſt unto another, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith, <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength, until every one appears before God in Sion,</hi> Pſal. 84. 7. And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>When he was a child, he ſpake as a child, understood as a child, and thought as a child, but when he became a man, he put away childiſh things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a perfection of ſincerity, and he, that through the faith and power of our Lord Jeſus, attains this perfection of ſincerity, ceaſeth from all ſin, and he that in this ſincerity, or any degree of it believes and walks in obedience to the Goſpel, is juſtified through the righteouſneſſe of our Lord Jeſus, of which he is an heir through faith.</p>
            <p>5. Query. <hi>Whether Jeſus Christ did not institute, and appoint cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ordinances under the Goſpel for his Churches to obſerve and keep until his coming?</hi> (1.) <hi>Did he not inſtitute that ordinance of his Supper, and enjoyn his diſciples to obſerve it in remembrance of him!</hi> Luke 22. 19, 20. <hi>And</hi> (2.) <hi>is it not recorded of the Primitive Church how they continued this ordinance?</hi> Acts 2. 46. (3.) <hi>Why doth the Apostle</hi> Paul <hi>commend the practice of it to the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>and tells them whence he had it? for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The matter in queſtion is a thing about which there hath been more idolatry, and evil practized by the falſe Chriſtians, than any other thing partaining to Chriſtian Religion, ſince the dark and long night of Apoſtacy that hath overſhadowed <hi>Christendome,</hi> which Apoſtacy was beginning to come in, even in the Apoſtles dayes. Oh! when I conſider the bloud of Chriſtians which hath been ſhed about this very thing, it doth afflict my very heart, and cauſe my ſoul to cry alas, alas, that ever Chriſtians ſhould be ſo far deluded, &amp; miſled, as to ſhed the bloud one of another about the outward practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which are but (in compariſon to the more weighty matters) as the very outward Courts or Suburbs of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>Chriſt did inſtitute the breaking of Bread,, as it is written, when our Saviour with his diſciples was eating the Paſſeover a Feaſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> pertaining to the miniſtration of the Law, in which was many ſhadows of good things to come. And as they were eating this Paſſover ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, he ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>With deſire have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to eat this Paſsover with you, before I ſuffer, for I ſay unto you, I will no more eat thereof, till it be fulfilled in the Kingdome of God,</hi> Luk. 22. 15, 16. and as they were eating, he took bread, and gave thanks, and break it, and gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is given for you, this doe in remembrance of me:</hi> likewiſe he took the Cup after Supper, ſaying, <hi>This Cup is the new Teſtament in my bloud which is ſhed for you,</hi> Mark 14. 20. Luke 22. 19, 20. and by this ſign, his death, who is our Paſſover was ſignified, or ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not onely by the Bread, and the Cup, but by the Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh, of which a bone was not to be broken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 46. in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95207:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> which practice, they continued unto his coming, even ſo to remember him when they break the Bread, and drank the Cup, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhewed forth his death till he came, not eating and drinking damnation unto themſelves, as thoſe who did, and doth break the Bread, and drink the Cup unworthily, who eats to the luſt, and drinks to the luſt, even feeding themſelves without fear, whoſe table is not the table of the Lord, but the table of Devils, at which they are ſo far from diſcerning the Lords body, and fulneſſe, (which fills all in all) that they neither break that Bread in remembrance of him, nor to him, but even to the luſt, by which he was crucified and ſlain; but the Diſciples (who practized this outward ſign by which his death was ſhewn) were witneſſes of his reſurrection, and coming again, not onely unto (but ſpiritually to dwell in) them according to his promiſe, where he ſaith, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſse, I will come unto you,</hi> John 14. 18. in which he eat with them, and they with him, as he ſaid, <hi>I will not henceforth drink of the fruit of the Vine, untill that day, I ſhall drink it new with you in my fathers Kingdome,</hi> Mat. 26. 29. and I ſay unro you, I will no more eat thereof, untill it be fulfilled in the Kingdome of God; but the inward enjoyment of the ſubſtance of this outward ſign (by which was ſignified the death or ſacrifice of Chriſt, the immaculate Lamb of God, who is our ſpiritual Paſſover that is ſacrificed for us) is a myſtery (which by the vulturous eye was never ſeen) as it is fulfilled to the true Diſciples in Chriſt ſpiritual Kingdome, in which our Saviour ſups with them, and they with him, and is no other then that ſpiritual Feaſt, which is kept amongſt the children of God, for whom Chriſt their Paſſover is ſacrificed, and by his power they purge out the old leaven, and keep this ſpiritual Feaſt not with the old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. 8. for the bread of God which comes down from Heaven, is that by which they keep this ſpiritual feaſt, and the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt is this bread which the holy people break, and ſpiritually feed upon, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his love is that ſpirituall wine, by which he doth wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſh their ſouls, through which they come to grow into the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe life, and in which they more abundantly partake of the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting conſolation that is in Chriſt Jeſus, in which they ſpiritually eat and drink with him, and he with them (who are his lillies) in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95207:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> Kingdome. And this is a ſmall hint of that ſpiritual Paſſeover or feaſt which was and is kept by the Saints in this glorious Goſpel-day, through which the night is expelling, and the ſhadowes vaniſhing away. Glory, glory be unto the Lord our God for ever.</p>
            <p>But to return, this practice of breaking of bread together, was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by the Apoſtles in the Churches, as <hi>I. B.</hi> hath already inſtanced, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46. <hi>And they brake bread from houſe to houſe, and ate their meat with ſingleneſs of heart,</hi> as is the practice of true Chriſtians at this day, and in which they ought to continue to the end, that whether they eat, they may eat unto the Lord, or whether they drink, they may do it unto him, not making an idol of the creature, or any Chriſtian practice be it never ſo good in it ſelf; but may both eye and diſcern the Lord in all their practices and duties, which was that good end for which the Apoſtle delivered unto the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the thing in queſtion practiſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles at the Paſſeover, which many did ſoon abuſe if not idolize even in his time, for which he often reproved them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. where he ſaith, <hi>When ye come together, this is not to eat the Lords Supper, for in eating e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one takes before other his own ſupper, and one is hungry, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other drunken;</hi> and tells them <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26. <hi>As often as they break the bread, and drink the cup, they ſhould do it in remembrance, ſaying, they that eat, and drink unworthily, eat and drink damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not diſcerning the Lords body,</hi> verſ. 29. Oh that all drunkards, and gluttoners, ignorant perſons who make an idol of the creature, in breaking the bread, and drinking the cup unworthily, Oh that they would ſeriouſly conſider, and lay theſe things to heart, that they may not henceforth any more break the bread, and drink the cup unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, in the ſinfull luſt of the fleſh, the doing of which brings them to be guilty of the body, and blood of the Lord, in that they eat to (and feed the) ſame luſts of the world, as was in them which ſlew him; and none can be partakers of the table of the Lord, while they thus feed at the table of Devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. But it may be the enemy will tell them, it is no ſuch thing, for they neither are nor drank that day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they break that bread and drink that cup, and call to natural me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with trembling and fear, before they practice the thing before mentioned, that Chriſts body was broken for them, and his bloud ſhed

               <hi>practice of our bleſſee Saviour, who when he fed ſo many thouſands, would first look up to heaven for a bleſsing upon what they enjoyed on earth,</hi> Mat. 6. 41. <hi>And after his Reſurrection, he practiſed the ſame thing amongſt his diſciples,</hi> Luke 24. 30. <hi>Whoſe bleſſed example the Apoſtle followed taking bread, and giving thanks in the preſence of them all,</hi> Acts 27. 35. <hi>further recommending it to the practice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that in every thing they would give thanks as the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning them,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſtians are bound to the practice of many religious duties which was practiſed by the people of God under the Law; for though the cerimonies, types, and ſhadws of the Law, or firſt Covenant are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed by the Goſpel, yet the weighty matters are not aboliſhed, or made void through faith in Chriſt Jeſus, as it is written, <hi>Do we through faith make void the Law, God forbid,</hi> Rom. 3. 31. Through faith we eſtabliſh the Law: for it is by virtue of faith in the Goſpel, that Chriſtians are fully enabled to practice thoſe religious duties, which were commanded under the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> to love God with all their heart, and with all their mind; for our Saviour calls this the firſt, and great Commandement, ſaying, the ſecond is like unto it, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, and on theſe two commandements hang the whole Law, and the Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38, 39, 40. theſe religious duties with many other righteous practiſes of the people of God under the Law, are indeed binding to Chriſtians under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>Firſt Chriſtians ought to live and continue in ſincere deſires after God at all times, and to pray unto him not onely at morning, evening, and at noon day, but at all ſeaſons and hours, wherein they ſhall find the immortal birth of life inclining their hearts to ſeek after him, and his ſpirit to help their infirmities, without the help of which, Chriſtians cannot pray, ask, or ſeek aright, as it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. 27. We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, and the motions of this immortal life, and ſpirit of our heavenly Father, is not limitted to dayes, ſet times, places or houres of dayes, but when, and what time it inclines and moves Chriſtians are to follow, and as they ſeek through, and by its aſſiſtance, they ſhall find, and as they ask in the life, and nature thereof, they ſhall receive theirs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95207:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> hearts deſire, and obtain the thing which they pray for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is lawfull for Gods people to ſet apart a time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſe, as did <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the reſt of the ſervants of the Lord, who, notwithſtanding the great afflictions, and perſecutions which attended them for righteouſneſſe ſake, and for their practice in the worſhip of God, yet did they continue not only to profeſſe him openly, but to worſhip him after their accuſtomed manner, as appears by the Scriptures which <hi>I. B.</hi> hath inſtanced, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10, 13. with ſeveral other Scriptures which might be mentioned, whoſe example herein I deſire the Lord may inſtruct all Chriſtians in ſincerity to follow, and continue in the practice of the doctrines &amp; exhortations of the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt, who exhorted the Saints not to forſake the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling themſelvs together, as the manner of ſome was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. but as the day approacheth, exhort one another, in which practice the true Chriſtians ever did walk and continue, notwithſtanding the cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution &amp; grievous afflictions that were inflicted upon them by ungodly men of this world for ſo doing, <hi>viz.</hi> their continuing in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and practice of meeting together, to wait upon, and worſhip the Lord in Spirit and truth, for which holy practice, ſo great were the ſufferings and afflictions by them indured, (as may be read at large in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories) that <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith in the book of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, what fires, what tortures, without reſpect either to age or ſex they were inforced to feel; then did the earth without doubt bewail her children, and the round world which containeth all things (being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with their bloud) made a dolefullamentation for them, and the day it ſelf provoked to mourn, was amazed for them, when the very barbarous Nations rejoyce for their ſakes, which received and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured them when they were afraid, and fled from us, keeping them as it were in a moſt loving, and amiable captivity, to which I may ſay, Alas, alas that ever any that profeſſe the ſame Chriſt, as theſe perſecuted Chriſtians ſuffered for, ſhould now <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> lib. 1. fol. 92.</note> become perſecutors, and not only of ſuch as in words deny him, but even of ſuch as confeſſe and believe in him, to be the only Saviour of the world. Surely the true Chriſtian ſoul that ſeriouſly conſidereth, will be greatly afflicted, and the heart that ſees it cannot but mourn in the beholding of the woful apoſtacy, darkneſſe, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in which many thouſand Chriſtians are fallen, who profeſſe Chriſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95207:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> in words, and yet walk ſo far contrary to the light of Chriſt, and are ſo far out of his nature, which is to ſhew kindneſſe, mercy, and love to all men, not only to them that believe, but to them that believe not, even with long patience to inſtruct them, that they may believe, and repent; but the heart that is poſſeſſed with the true knowledge of the woful backſliding from the ancient doctrine and truth of the Goſpel (in which thoſe perſecuted Chriſtians walked both in, and after the Apoſtles dayes) beholding this diſmal night that is come upon multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Chriſtians, cannot but even take up a lamentation, and cry, Alas, alas, that ever any who profeſſe Chriſt ſhould be ſo far void of his bowels, and mercies, and ſhould have ſo far loſt all tenderneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that they ſhould even now perſecute their brethren, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and believe in the ſame God and Chriſt, as they in words profeſſe and believe, having no other reaſon for their ſo doing, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they differ from them in ſome ceremonial and outward practices of Chriſtianity. Alas, alas, that ever the Devil, the enemy of mankind ſhould ſo far delude and deceive men, who agree in the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one God and Chriſt, which is the main and weighty matter in the outward profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion. Oh that ever they ſhould be ſo far darkned, and miſled to afflict and perſecute about the ſmaller matters or outward practices of Religion, whenas it ought to be a duty incumbent upon all who profeſſe the name of Chriſt, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade one another in the power of the Goſpel: and if the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cannot overcome the errour of the mind in the falſe Chriſtian, after this manner he ought notwithſtanding to walk in love towards him, and leave him to the Lord who is that great Potter that hath power over all men to change from errour to truth, and out of death into life, when, and what time ſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſtians are to mind in that ſerious and weighty duty of Prayer, the motions and leadings of Gods Spirit, through which their infirmities are helped, and they not praying in their own name or will, but in the name of Chriſt, their prayers become effectual, and God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers them in the things they pray for, as it is written, <hi>John</hi> 14. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is a duty incumbent upon all true Chriſtians to uſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily duties, <hi>viz.</hi> to pray unto him as they are led thereunto by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly birth and Spirit which of him they have received. And parents
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95207:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> ought to inſtruct their Children by word, and godly example, as they may find the Spirit of Chriſt lead them ſo to do, by the virtue and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of which their exhortations will become effectual to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants, not only to turn them from errour unto truth, but to eſtabliſh and build them up in the truth, that they may ſerve the Lord in their day; and herein all Chriſtian parents and maſters of families ought to follow the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in commanding their houſholds after them to walk in the holy commands of God, and to ſerve him in their generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiſhly, the Scriptures were written for our learning; therefore it is neceſſary for Chriſtians to read them, and to confer about the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things ſignified of in them all their life long, as they are inclined thereunto by the life and Spirit that gave them forth; for though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life cannot be found in the Scriptures, yet they teſtify of Chriſt, in whom it is to be found; and the holy ſayings contained therein (which were given by the divine inſpiration of God) are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 16. 17. Therefore all true Chriſtians prizeth the Scriptures, for unto ſuch they are comfortable, and bear true teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that living way and truth, in and by which we have eternal redemption.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it is neceſſary for Gods people to pray unto him, and to beg his bleſſing with and upon thoſe creaturely benefits which they receive from the hand of their heavenly Father, and to return him thanks for his unſpeakable mercies towards them, which was the moving cauſe of that heavenly viſitation by which the Lord God hath viſited his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the day ſpring from on high, through which many that have ſate in darkneſſe, are now both come to ſee and walk in the light of life: bleſſed be the Lord our God for evermore.</p>
            <p>7. Query. <hi>Whether it be not lawfull for Chriſtians to give a civil reſpect to the ſeveral degrees and relations in which perſons may ſtand? as</hi> (1.) <hi>Whether the younger ought not to reverence the elder? as ſaith the Scripture, Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man,</hi> Lev. 19. 32. <hi>and</hi> (2.) <hi>Whether a Christian may not evidence his reſpect by ſome outward action or gesture of his body, according to the custome of the Countrey he liveth in? as</hi> Abraham
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95207:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>bowed to the ſons of Heth,</hi> Gen. 23. 12. <hi>So did</hi> Nathan <hi>a Prophet to King David,</hi> 1. King, 1. 23. <hi>and</hi> (3.) <hi>Is it not lawful for Christians to expreſſe their reſpects by giving to every man the titles belonging to him, in reference to the ſeveral dignities or places they may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to? as</hi> Luke <hi>doth</hi> Theophilus, <hi>calling him moſt excellent,</hi> Luke 1. 3. <hi>So</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Felix, <hi>calling him moſt noble</hi> Felix, Acts 26. 25. <hi>and</hi> John <hi>to the elect Lady,</hi> 2 John 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is lawful for people to give civil reſpect to the ſeveral relations and degrees in which perſons may ſtand. Firſt, Chriſtians ought to reſpect with ſubjection and obedience, either actively, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commands of their magiſtrates; or paſſively, by ſuffering for not doing, in caſe any thing ſhould be impoſed contrary to Gods law, and a good conſcience, by the authority, either ſet up, or permitted by the Lord to be ſet up over them, and in ſo doing they give the reſpect that is due to men, thus related unto them as Superiours, whoſe honour and reſpect conſiſts not in putting off the hat, and bowing the knee and body, but in obeying their juſt commands for the reſpect by ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or bowing to mens perſons, who wear the gay cloathing, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and he that gives it tranſgreſſeth the law of God, <hi>James</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the younger ought to reverence the elder by an inward love and reſpect. The true reverence from children to their parents hath its beeing in the heart, and is evidenced by outward obedience to their juſt and lawful commands, and bodily actions, of not deſpiſing them when their ſtrength faileth, but in lowlineſſe and humility to help them in their old age, not following the example of the Phariſees, whom our Saviour reproved for making the commands of God void by their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which command was to honour father and mother, for they ſaid, whoſoever ſhould ſay to his father or mother, it is a gift by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou might be profited by me, and honours not his father or mother, he ſhall go free, and thus they broke the command by their traditions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 4, 5, 6, 7. Neither following the example of <hi>Ham,</hi> but the good example of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> who covered their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 22, 23. and in ſo doing the love and reſpect of children is demonſtrated towards their parents, and not by putting off the hat, and bowing the knee according to the cuſtome of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and people where they dwell; for both vain and idolatrous may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95207:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> the cuſtome of the people be herein, as in the dayes of old, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 32. Though <hi>Abraham</hi> did bow to the ſons of <hi>Heth,</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> to King <hi>David</hi> in that miniſtration, in which the types and ſhadows were in force, and the ſeed not come to full dominion, but he outwardly as a ſtranger in the land, which God had promiſed to give to his ſeed after him for an inheritance, I ſay <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and <hi>Nathan</hi>'s example herein is no more binding to Chriſtians under the Goſpel miniſtration, then is their example of ſwearing, outward circumciſion, with divers other things that they were commanded or permitted of God to doe in that miniſtration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is lawfull for Chriſtians to give unto every man thoſe titles which of right belong unto him, according to the place or office to which he may be advanced, as to call a King, King; and a noble man, noble man; and a Judge, Judge; and a man that excells in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and moderation may be called excellent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this wiſe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may expreſſe his love, and reſpect to perſons advanced to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned dignities, and not by worſhipping and adoring their perſons: for that is a tranſgreſſion of the law of God, <hi>James</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>8. Query. <hi>Whether Christians may not make uſe of, and take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thoſe creatures God affords us, either for food or clothing? And</hi> (1.) <hi>whether at ſometimes it be not lawful to feaſt and enjoy the creatures, afforded for our uſe in a lawful mirth? provided it be done in its proper ſeaſon and with moderation,</hi> Eccl. 3. 12, 13. <hi>And</hi> (2.) <hi>whether it be lawful for Chriſtians to wear what apparel they ſhall think best in their own Christian prudence, to be apparelled in, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceſſe: did not God command the children of Iſrael that they ſhould borrow jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold of ths</hi> Egyptians, <hi>Ex.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>And</hi> Abraham<hi>'s ſervant gave unto</hi> Rebecca <hi>bracelets for her hands which ſhe alſo wore,</hi> Gen. 24. 22, 30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſtians may make uſe of the creatures, for through faith, and the birth immortal they only of all people upon earth have right to the creatures, as it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. where the Apoſtle ſaith, All things are theirs, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are yours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet in the creatures they muſt not ſo delight, as to love and worſhip them more then their Creatour, who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95207:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> is God bleſſed for ever. Therefore if any who profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian ſo love and delight in the creatures, as that his love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Lord is made leſſe thereby, ſuch a one may profeſſe himſelf a Chriſtian in words, but in works he denies Chriſt. Therefore all Chriſtian men had need to be watchfull againſt the temptations of that luſtful ſpirit of the world, which would lead them to abuſe the creatures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, its lawful to enjoy the creatures afforded for us in the joy and mirth which cometh of, or is allowed by the Holy Ghoſt, but not in the vain mirth and fooliſh pleaſures of ſinful worldly men, who have their end in lamentation and wo; for it is better (as the wiſe man ſaith) to go to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of ſuch mirth and feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for that is the end of all men, the living will lay it to heart, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 2, 3. But if a man doth eat, and drink, and enjoy the good of his labour in the covenant of God that is to the praiſe of God, and to his ſpiritual and creaturely comfort, in this fading world, in which God fills his heart with content and ſatisfaction, whether he hath much or little of the periſhing things of this life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, its lawful for a true Chriſtian, who is guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, to wear what apparel he by the wiſdome and inſtruction of the Spirit ſhall ſee both to be lawful and expedient for him to wear, that he in that, as in all other things, may give a good example, not only to them that are weak, but that alſo he may be a pattern of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto thoſe that are without, and may ſhine as a light in the world, that they ſeeing his good works and example, may be made to glorifie his Father which is in heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exhorted the Chriſtian women to adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel, with ſhamefaſtneſſe, and ſobriety, not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly array, but which becometh women profeſſing godlineſſe with good works, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>9. Query. <hi>Whether when Chriſtians are met together for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God, they may then be ſilent, and depart without any thing done for the edification of one another? or</hi> (1.) <hi>Whether they ought not rather to ſtir up, and exhort one another to continue in the faith and practice of the Goſpel? as the Apoſtles of old did, who when they met together ſpent the time in praying with and exhorting one another,</hi> Acts 1. 13, 14. Acts 12. 12. (2.) <hi>Whether to ſpeak in a</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95207:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>ſtrange tongue, or to be wholly ſilent when the people of God are met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, be not one and the ſame thing? the former of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle forbids, as no way tending to edification,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 4. to the 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When Chriſtians are met together to worſhip God in Spirit, they may be ſilent if nothing be given them from the Lord to ſay, for God who is a Spirit may be as truly worſhipped in Spirit, and adored in the hearts of his people when there is no words, as when there is words of God given them to ſpeak to the edification one of another. But if any ſhould meet together with a reſolution to be ſilent, and not to wait for, but to quench the motions of the Spirit, if any thing ſhould be given, this would be worſe then to ſpeak in an unknown tongue.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for if any thing be freely given, Chriſtians ought freely to ſpeak what from God they have received to the edification one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Saints of old did when they were met together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26: Whether by prophecy, doctrine, or prayer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though people may ſometimes meet in ſilence, in the name and truth of Jeſus; yet it's not one and the ſame thing, with ſpeaking in an unknown tongue, for the unknown tongue may be ſo far from edifying in the truth, that people may rather be led from the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But when Chriſtians are met together in Chriſt's name, though they be ſilent for a time, yet God hath, and will fulfill his promiſe by the manifeſtation of his preſence amongſt them, by whoſe ſpirit they receive inward teaching both to comfort, build up, and inſtruct them, ſo that many have gone away ſatisfied with the ſpiritual ſence of the Lords heavenly preſence, which hath been ſeen and enjoyed in ſilence amonſt them, by the incomes of whoſe love his children are refreſhed in preaching, and without outward preaching, glory unto his name for ever: whoſe ſpirit cannot be limited that he ſhall not appear to the joy and comfort of his people, either by, or without outward preaching; for it hath been the manner and practice of the Prophets, and people of God to ſit together in ſilence, when nothing was given them of the Lord to ſay, though it was day after day as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 15, 16. then I came to them of the captivity at <hi>Telabib</hi> that dwelt by the river <hi>Chebar,</hi> and ſate where they ſate, and remained there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed among them ſeven dayes, and it came to paſs at the end of ſeven dayes, the word of the Lord came unto me ſaying: ſo it ſeems
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95207:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> they ſate together in ſilence, till the word of the Lord came to the Prophet, although he was a Prophet, and the hand of the Lord upon him; yet muſt he not ſpeak till it was given him from the Lord what he ſhould ſay: and all preachers, and people, who are not in, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this example in meetings together, are ſuch as come under the wo due to them which uſe their tongues, and ſay he ſaith, howbeit the Lord hath not ſpoken to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 31. Therefore how much better were it for them to wait upon, and worſhip God in ſilence, when nothing is given them, or revealed unto any of them from the Lord to ſpeak, then to uſe their tongues, when he hath not ſpoken to them: I ſhall leave to the ſober minded to judge.</p>
            <p>10. Query. <hi>Whether Chriſtians that do not palpably contradict the practice of Godlineſs, may not live with and have charity towards one another, though different in judgements? And,</hi> (1.) <hi>whether this hath not rendred the popiſh religion more odious, becauſe they have ſo little charity for any that differ from them who ſtile all to be hereticks that are not of their way? Or,</hi> (2.) <hi>whether any of the Apoſtles, or our Saviour himſelf, did ever condemn others upon this account only, but on the contrary, when the Apostles told our Saviour they had ſeen one caſting out Devils in his name, yet followed not him, Christ bids them not forbid him, alledging that he which is not againſt us is with us,</hi> Luke 9. 49, 50. <hi>And ſo the Apoſtle would have every man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own mind,</hi> Rom. 14. 5. <hi>and I know no reaſon why ye ſhould condemn any man for being in the dark becauſe he ſees not by your light?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſtians ought to have charity one towards another, and they who are true Chriſtians have (not only in name but in nature) Charity, and love which reacheth even to thoſe who differ from them in judgement.</p>
            <p>Firſt by love they labour to inſtruct thoſe Chriſtians who are in error, that if poſſible they might reclaim them from error, by the force of the love and word of God; but the ſpiritual ſtriving and war (on the true Chriſtian's part) is not againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt that ſpirit of darkneſs which miſguides the mind. If the true Chriſtian doth not hereby gain the falſe Chriſtian to the way of life; yet he ſhould walk in all love, and gentleneſs towards him, not endeavouring by force, and violence to deſtroy his body for the error of his mind, or to cut off
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95207:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> his life from the earth, as the Papiſts and falſe Chriſtians ever have done againſt thoſe true Chriſtians, whoſe minds and conſciences they could never overcome, for which cruel perſecution they have no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongſt the Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe practice therein hath ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Church with the guilt of bloud, which hath and will cauſe a curſe and infamy to come upon them, which never ſhall be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All men in the world are in the dark that in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſees not by the light of the Lamb in which we and all Nations of them that are ſaved muſt walk, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24. But it is not the practice of Chriſtians who are grown in grace to condemn and judge others, becauſe they are not fully come up to their rule and degree of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in every particular, though ſome who are young in the truth (and yet diſciples) may through weakneſſe (if not watchful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to hearken unto their Lord and Maſter) even erre in thoſe things as the diſciples of old were apt to do, as <hi>I. B.</hi> hath already inſtanced, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 49, 50. who forbid the man to caſt out devils in the name of Chriſt, becauſe he followed them not, and would have had fire to come down from heaven upon thoſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> that did not preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54.</p>
            <p>11. Query. <hi>Whether it be not the duty of Chriſtians to obſerve and ſet apart one day in ſeven for the more ſolemn ſervice of God? and</hi> (1.) <hi>Whether God himſelf did not appoint, and the people of God in all ages keep ſuch a day,</hi> Gen. 2. 2, 3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8. (2.) <hi>Whether the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was ever abrogated by Jeſus Chriſt, or only changed, and another kept in the room of the firſt; and</hi> (3.) <hi>Whether the firſt day of the week be not the true Chriſtian Sabbath? We read that it was the cuſtome of the Apoſtles chiefly to meet on this day,</hi> John 20. 19. Acts 20. 7. <hi>and that they made collections for the poor on this day,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>and</hi> John <hi>was in the Spirit on the Lords day,</hi> Rev. 1. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſtians did ſet apart times to wait upon and worſhip the Lord in Spirit and truth, and they did meet together to perform this ſolemn ſervice and duty to God upon the firſt day of the week, as the Scriptures teſtify which <hi>I. B.</hi> hath inſtanced, and that on that day they made collections for charitable uſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, But that they were commanded in the ſame manner to obſerve that day, as the Jews were to obſerve the ſeventh day, that I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95207:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> and I alſo do deny that that day was ſet apart and brought in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> room of the ſeventh day to anſwer that end for which the ſeventh day Sabbath was given, which was a ſign of that happy reſtauration which ſhould and is come to mankind by the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, in whoſe day mans ſoul is redeemed from the bondage of corruption, and recovered from under the fore travail and pain of the curſe, into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Gods children, where all weights and burthens are caſt off, and the ſoul comes to be perfectly freed from its long captivity and ſore bondage, through which it returns into that ſpiritual reſt which the outward day was but a ſhadow of, and all who are come into this endleſſe Sabbath, or holy day of God, their ſouls dwell at eaſe, and they are in perfect reſt, ſo as to bear no burthen, neither to travail under the load of ſin and the curſe any more; and this is a ſmall hint of that felicity and happy ſtate which God in mercy figured out unto man, while he was yet under the burthen by the outward Sabbath day, or ſign of reſt, as it is written, I gave them my Sabbath for a ſign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. Let no man judge you in meats, or in drinks in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new Moon, or of the Sabbath day, which are ſhadows of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt. Therefore I ſay the day of Chriſt being dawned, and he the ſubſtance being come, the outward figure muſt needs be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, and the ſhadow paſt away.</p>
            <p>12. Query. <hi>Whether it be not lawful for Chriſtians to ſwear, if called thereunto for the attestation of ſome truth? and</hi> (1.) <hi>Whether</hi> Abraham <hi>did ſin in making his ſervant to ſwear unto him.</hi> Gen. 24. 3. <hi>Or</hi> (2.) <hi>Whether ſwearing be not a ready way to put an end to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, as the Apostle ſaith,</hi> Heb. 6. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a point about which much hath been very fully and clearly written by ſeveral other hands, therefore I need not ſay much to it, only this I ſay, 'tis not lawfull for a Chriſtian under the Goſpel miniſtration to ſwear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, though <hi>Abraham</hi> did not ſin in cauſing his ſervant to ſwear, and though thoſe holy men did not ſin, who (under the firſt covenant) ſwore the Lord lived in truth, righteous, and judgement (ſwearing and many other things being then lawfull for them to practice) yet, ſuch things are not lawfull, neither uſefull for the Saints to practice under the Goſpel, this particular practice of ſwearing was not in the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95207:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> forbidden. Therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. it hath been ſaid of old time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but performe thine oaths unto the Lord. But he gives his Diſciples a new command, quite contrary to what was practiſed herein by the people of God in the old time, in that he ſaith unto them, ſwear not at all, neither by Heaven for it is Gods Throne, nor by the Earth for it is his Footſtool, neither by <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for it is the City of the great King, neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thine Head, becauſe thou can'ſt not make one hair white, or black, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34, 35, 36. By this abſolute command he not only forbids vain ſwearing, which was fully forbidden in the law of God before, but he poſitively excludes all manner of ſwearing in the dayes of the Goſpel, and likewiſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. Above all things my brethren ſwear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth neither by any other oath, but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, leaſt you fall into condemnation: which two teſtimonies are ſufficient to confirme the truth unto all true Chriſtian men, that it is in no wiſe lawfull for them to ſwear in any caſe. Many more teſtimonies might be inſtanced out of the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories of the ancient Chriſtians; ſome of whome, holding it in no wiſe lawfull for Chriſtian men to ſwear, ſuffered death for the profeſſion of Chriſt. <note n="a" place="margin">

That an oath for confirmation amongſt men is to them an end of ſtrife; yet this doth in no wiſe juſtifie, or prove ſwearing lawfull amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for he ſpeaks that by way of alluſion, as being the ſtrongeſt bond in the old time (in which the promiſe was made) whereby men could
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95207:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> bind themſelves, to ſet forth unto believers the certainty of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, being confirmed by ſuch a ſtrong bond as an oath was among men in the old time, when the promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed after him; and as for the Apoſtles ſaying, an oath among men is to them an end of ſtrife, I ſay, that did rather allude, or relate to what was at any time done for the ending of ſtrife amongſt thoſe <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who had not received the Goſpel, then that any ſuch thing was done or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, amongſt thoſe believers to whom he writ his Epiſtle. For if he had inſtanced any ſuch practice amongſt them he ſhould not have ſaid an oath amongſt men, but an oath amongſt you, &amp;c. Which he did not.</p>
            <p>13. Query. <hi>Whether it be not the great duty and concernment of every Chriſtian to plead for and vindicate all ſuch Goſpel truths as he hath formerly received, and yet believeth, and</hi> (1.) <hi>whether a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may not earneſtly contend for the truth once delivered?</hi> Jude 3. (2.) <hi>whether it be not the duty of all Chriſtians with readinſs to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of his faith to him that asketh him?</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 15. <hi>And</hi> (3.) <hi>whether it be not your concernment to return ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer to the Author of theſe Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a duty of concernment to every child of God both to plead for, and vindicate the truth, (the knowledge of which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) by the utmoſt force of thoſe ſpiritual weapons, or arguments wherewith he is furniſhed thereunto, by the word, and counſel of the Lord, againſt all thoſe that may gain ſay it, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, practice, or converſation, following the example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and meſſengers of the great King. The weapons of whoſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far were not carnal, neither was their war againſt the fleſh and bloud of men in error: but the weapons wherewith they warred were ſpiritual, and mighty through God to the deſtroying of that ſpirit of wickedneſs, which leads into error, and alſo to the recovering many out of error, who have been captivated in error. And they that are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the ſpiritual wiſdome, word, and power of the Lord God, by which many are turned to righteouſneſs, they ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of heaven, and as the ſtarrs for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it's the duty of the children of God, who in meaſure expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience redemption, and ſanctification by Chriſt Jeſus, to give a reaſon (according to their ability with meekneſs and fear) of that precious hope, and faith, through which they have, or may overcome in the day of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95207:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> tryal, and hour of temptation, which cometh upon all the world to try them, that dwell upon the Earth; and that excellent hope and faith (in which the Saints are preſerved in this day, and hour of tryal, and through which they ſhall be purified, and made more white, that their innocency may ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdome of their Father, and which keeps from fainting to the end) is of more worth then gold that periſheth, and is not to be valued with all created excellencies, or compared with any glory of this fading world, therefore I may ſay of the faith and hope, of which Chriſtians ought to give a reaſon, as <hi>Job</hi> did of wiſdome, man knows not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having in the love and fear of the Lord returned an anſwer to</hi> I. B. <hi>his Queries, and therein given ſome reaſon and account of our faith and judgement in the things queried, its deſired that</hi> I. B. <hi>may anſwer theſe following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in the ſame love, that we may know a reaſon of his faith and judgement concerning the things queried.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. WHether Chriſt by that one act of his death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath ſo done away or blotted out the ſins of the children of men, that the divine juſtice of his father is ſo anſwerd, or ſatisfied thereby, that he looks upon men to be in his Son, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are yet ſinners, and accepts them, as perfectly righteous in his ſight, only in and through what Ieſus hath done for them by his death upon the Croſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 2. Whether God who is the righteous Judge of all the world, doth ſo impute his righteouſneſſe as to justifie any man upon the earth thereby, in the ſelf ſame capacity as his righteous law in Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. Whether any man upon earth is abſolutely acqvitted and freed from ſin, by virtue of what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, whiles as yet the witneſſe of Gods Spirit in his own heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience condemns him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 4. Whether there is any ſuch thing, as that any mans ſins are done away past, preſent, and to come, whiles as yet he doth not ceaſe to commit ſin?</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95207:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Query</hi> 5. And if the eternal God doth impute the righteouſneſſe of his Son, ſo as to justifie any, while they do not yet, ceaſe to commit ſin, why doth he not ſo unto all, ſeeing all his ways are equal, and there is no reſpect of perſons with him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 6. What, and where is that law by which comes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin, without which the Apostle ſaid he was alive, but when it came ſin revived, and he died?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 7. Was it only the letter of the ten Commandments without him, which he had and was zealous for, while he was yet alive in ſin, or the light and Spirit of Gods law inwardly manifeſted in his heart?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 8. And if ſo, whether it was not the very ſame law in nature and quality as made him free from the law of ſin and death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 9. And what, and where is that law which the Apoſtle ſaith hath dominion over a man, ſo long as he liveth, through which he is bound as a woman by the law of her husband, is it the law of God or the law of ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qeery</hi> 10. If it be the law of ſin, how and by what means may thoſe perſons which are bound by it, come to know the heavenly virtue of the body of Chriſt, through which they may die to it, and know the chain broken?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 11. Whether the example of all that the Apoſtles and Saints practiſed in the primitive times be abſolute binding at this day to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 12. Whether many outward things, which rather pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the typical or ſhadowy part of the Law that is vaniſhed away, then to the glorious Goſpel, was not practiſed by Chriſtian believers under the ministration of the Goſpel in the Apoſtles dayes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 13. And if ſo, what was the abſolute reaſon thereof, was it becauſe the Apostles were commanded thereunto by God, or becauſe of the weakneſſe of the people that he ſuffered his miniſters to bear with them for a time, that could not (while young in the truth, and their eyes much outward) eaſily be brought off of many outward things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 14. What was the Apostles end or Gods end by them in not only permitting or ſuffering thoſe perſons that received their Goſpel te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, to practiſe many ordinances and ſhadows pertaining to the law, but that alſo they did ſometime practiſe them themſelves? was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95207:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Lord had a purpoſe to eſtabliſh them as his ordinances to be practiſed by all ages, or were they allowed to practiſe them in the peoples weakneſſe for a time, that thereby they might gain the more out of them into that everlaſt laſting truth which is the ſubſtance of types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows where people come to ſee beyond all outward things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 15. And if they that were partakers of the everlaſting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance did make uſe and continue in the practiſe of any outward things which were but outwardly ſhadows of what they inwardly enjoyed, was it becauſe they had need ſo to do, or becauſe of the weakneſſe of others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 16. Whether <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm with water was not of, and belonging to the miniſtration of the Law, under which the carnal waſhings and outward ordinances were inforce?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 17. And if ſo, why was water Baptiſm practiſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles under the Goſpel, was it done by abſolute command from God, as neceſſary unto ſalvation, or to anſwer the weakneſſe of thoſe believing Chriſtians, who after they believed, deſired it, and being weak could not well he ſatisfied without it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 18. And if it was done by abſolute command from God, as neceſſary to ſalvation, how is it that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (who was made inſtrumental to convert ſo many thouſands) had not a command to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize with water, as well as to preach the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 19. And if to anſwer the deſire of Chriſtians in weakneſſe was not the reaſon of the Apoſtles baptizing with water, but that they had an abſolute commiſſion to do it from God; then I deſire, that (in anſwer to this Query) the Scripture or Scriptures (if there be any) may be ſhewed, in which water is expreſſed to be that means with whith they were to baptize Chriſtians into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt?</p>
